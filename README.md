# Adafruit-style Arduino library for ST7920 displays in SPI mode (PSB=0)

This inherits from Adafruit_GFX libraries.
It should behave exactly like Adafruit's own Adafruit_SSD1306 I2C displays (but without SSD1306 scroll etc).

Adafruit_KS0108_kbv inherits all the methods from  
the Adafruit_GFX class: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview  
and Print class: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_ST7920_kbv. Check that the Adafruit_ST7920_kbv folder contains Adafruit_KS0108_kbv.cpp and Adafruit_KS0108_kbv.

Place the Adafruit_ST7920_kbv library folder your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE

Also requires the Adafruit_GFX library for Arduino.
